== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-statistics` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure the Date and Time is set correctly in WordPress.
4. Go to the plugin settings page and configure as required (note this will also download the GeoIP database for the fist time).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where's the Admin Manual? =
The admin manual is installed as part of the plugin, simply go to Statistics->Manual to view it.  At the top of the page will also be two icons that will allow you to download it in either ODT or HTML formats.

= What do I do if the plug does not work? =
Disable / Enable the plugin.  You may also want to remove and re-install it.

= All visitors are being set to unknown for their location? =
Make sure you've downloaded the GeoIP database and the GeoIP code is enabled.  

Also, if your running an internal test site with non-routable IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x or 172.28.x.x or 10.x.x.x), these addresses will come up as unknown always.

= I was using V3.2 and now that I've upgraded my visitors and visits have gone way down? =
The webcrawler detection code has been fixed and will now exclude them from your stats, don't worry, it now reflects a more accurate view of actual visitors to your site.

= GeoIP is enabled but no hits are being counted? =
The GeoIP code requires several things to function, PHP 5.3 or above, the bcmath extension, the cURL extension and PHP cannot be running in safe mode.  All of these conditions are checked for but there may be additional items required.  Check your PHP log files and see if there are any fatal errors listed.

= How much memory does PHP Statistics require? =
This depends on how many hits your site gets.  The data collection code is very light weight, however the reporting and statistics code can take a lot of memory to process.  The longer you collect data for the more memory you will need to process it.  At a bare minimum, a basic WordPress site with WP Statistics should have at least 32 meg of RAM available for a page load.  Sites with lots of plugins and high traffic should look at significantly increasing that (128 to 256 meg is not unreasonable).

= I've enabled IP subnet exclusions and now no visitors are recorded? =
Be very careful to set the subnet mask correctly on the subnet list, it is very easy to catch too much traffic.  Likewise if you are excluding a single IP address make sure to include a subnet mask of 32 or 255.255.255.255 otherwise the default subnet of 0 will be used, catching all ip addresses.

= I'm not receiving e-mail reports? =
Make sure you have WordPress configured correctly for SMTP and also check your WP Cron is working correctly.  You can use [Cron View](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cron-view) to examine your WP Cron table and see if there are any issues.

= Does WP Statistics support multi-site? =
WP Statistics hasn't been tested with multi-site and there have been some issues reported with getting it enabled correctly on all sites in a network.

= Does WP Statistics report on post hits? =
Yes, version 6.0 has introduced page hit statistics!

= Does WP Statistics track the time of the hits? =
No.

= The GeoIP database isn't downloading and when I force a download through the settings page I get the following error: "Error downloading GeoIP database from: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz - Forbidden" =
This means that MaxMind has block the IP address of your webserver, this is often the case if it has been blacklisted in the past due to abuse.

You have two options:
- Contact MaxMind and have them unblock your IP address
- Manually download the database

To manually download the database and install it take the following steps:

- On another system (any PC will do) download the maxmind database from http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz
- Decompress the database
- Connect to your web host and create a "wp-statistics" directory in your wordpress uploads folder (usually it is located in wp-content, so you would create a directory "wp-content/uploads/wp-statistics").
- Upload the GeoLite-Country.mmdb file to the folder you just created.

You can also ask MaxMind to unblock your host.  Note that automatic updates will not function until you can successfully download the database from your web server.

= I've activated the plugin but the menus don't show up and nothing happens? =

WP Statistics requires PHP 5.3, if it has detected an older version of PHP installed it will active but it will display an error on your plugin list just below the WP Statistics entry to let you know.

If there is no error message there may be something else wrong, your first thing to try is disabling your other plugins as they can sometimes cause conflicts.

If you still don't see the menus, go to the support forums and open a new thread and we'll try to help out.

= I'm using another statistics plugin/service and get different numbers for them, why? =

Pretty much every plugin/service is going to give you different results for visits and vistors, there are several reasons for this:

* Web crawler detection
* Detection method (javascript vs server side PHP)
* Centralized exclusions

Services that use centralized databases, like Google Analytics, for spam and robot detection have better detection than WP Statistics can.  The trade off of course is relaying on an external service.

= When I upgrade or install WP Statistics I get an error message like "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING or '('" =

Since WP Statistics 8.0, PHP 5.3 or above has been required.  If you are using an older version of PHP it cannot understand the new syntax included in WP Statistics 8.0 and generates a parse error. 

You have two choices:

1. Upgrade your PHP to 5.3 or above (recommended)
2. Downgrade WP Statistics to 7.4

Your hosting provider should have a newer version of PHP available, sometimes you must activate it through your hosting control panel.

Since the last release of PHP 5.2 is over 3 years ago (Jan 2011) and is no longer supported or receiving security fixes, if your provider does not support a newer version you should probably be moving hosting providers.

Having said that if you cannot move to PHP 5.3 or above you can still use WP Statistics 7.4, which you can download (here)[https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-statistics.7.4.zip] and install manually through the WordPress plugin installer.

If you have done an upgrade and you can no longer access your site due to the parse error you will have to manually delete the wp-statistics directory from your wordpress/wp-content/plugins directory, either through your hosting providers control panel or FTP.

= I've decided to stay with WP Statistics 7.4 even though its a bad idea but now WordPress continuously reports there are updates available, how can I stop that? =

If you are staying on WP Statistics 7.4 WordPress will, through the Dashboard and Admin bar, let you know that a newer version is available.  However that can be annoying, there are some plugins in the WordPress directory to help though.

(Disable Updates Manager)[https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/] is one I found doing a quick search and lets you disable individual plugins from the update process.
