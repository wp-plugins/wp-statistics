== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to update to version 3.0? =
Get Plugin updates via Automatic only.

= If the plug does not work? =
Disable / Enable the plugin.

= All visitors are being set to unknown for their location? =
Make sure you've downloaded the GeoIP database and the GeoIP code is enabled.  

Also, if your running an internal test site with non-routable IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x or 172.28.x.x or 10.x.x.x), these addresses will come up as unknown always.

= I was using V3.2 and now that I've upgraded my visitors and visits have gone way down? =
The webcrawler detection code has be Fixes and will now exclude them from your stats, don't worry, it now reflects a more accurate view of actual visitors to your site.

= GeoIP is enabled but no hits are being counted? =
The GeoIP code requires several things to function, PHP 5.3 or above, the bcmath extension, the cURL extension and PHP cannot be running in safe mode.  All of these conditions are checked for but there may be additional items required.  Check your PHP log files and see if there are any fatal errors listed.

= How much memory does PHP Statistics require? =
This depends on how many hits your site gets.  The data collection code is very light weight, however the reporting and statistics code can take a lot of memory to process.  The longer you collect data for the more memory you will need to process it.  At a bare minimum, a basic WordPress site with WP Statitics should have at least 32g of RAM.  Sites with lots of plugins and high traffic should look at significantly increasing that.

= I've enabled IP subnet exclusions and now no visitors are recorded? =
Be very careful to set the subnet mask correctly on the subnet list, it is very easy to catch too much traffic.  Likewise if you are excluding a single IP address make sure to include a subnet mask of 32 or 255.255.255.255 otherwise the default subnet of 0 will be used, catching all ip addresses.

= I'm not receiving e-mail reports? =
Make sure you have WordPress configured correctly for SMTP and also check your WP Cron is working correctly.  You can use [Cron View](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cron-view) to examine your WP Cron table and see if there are any issues.

= Does WP Statistics support multi-site? =
WP Statistics hasn't been tested with multi-site and there have been some issues reported with getting it enabled correctly on all sites in a network.

= Does WP Statistics report on post hits? =
No, WP Statistics only tracks total hits to your site, not to individual pages.

= Does WP Statistics track the time of the hits? =
No.

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 5.3 = 
* Robots list updated, please either go to "Statistics->Settings->IP/Robot Exclusions", "Reset to Default" and then save or manually make the changes which can be found in the change log details.

= 4.8 =
* BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE INSTALLING!
* This update includes a new database table, you should not lose any data to make sure to backup your database just in case.

= 4.5 =
* As of V4.3, the robots list is now stored in the database and is user configurable.  Because of this updates to the default robots list will not automatically be added during upgrades.  You can either go to "Statistics->Settings->IP/Robot Exclusions", "Reset to Default" and then save or manually make the changes which can be found in the change log details.

= 4.0 =
* BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE INSTALLING!
* IF YOU ARE NOT RUNNING V3.2 ALL OF YOUR DATA WILL BE LOST IF YOU UPGRADE TO V4.0 or above!
* GeoIP is enabled by default but you must download the GeoIP database before any Countries will be detected correctly.  Go to the settings page and it will download automatically, if it does not or it fails, simply go to the bottom of the page and re-download it.
* The new browser detection code uses "MSIE" instead of "IE", your database will be updated automatically during install to reflect this.
* As the webcrawler code is now working, you'll probably see a significant change in the "Unknown" browser category and the number of hits your site gets.
